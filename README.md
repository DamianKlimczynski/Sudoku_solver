# Sudoku Solver

Welcome to Sudoku Solver, a Python program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm. This project represents my journey as a beginner Python programmer.

## How It Works

Sudoku Solver employs a backtracking algorithm, a common technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems. The algorithm iterates through each cell, attempting different numbers until a solution is found. If an incorrect number is selected, the algorithm backtracks to a previous cell and tries a different number.

Additionally, the program rigorously checks for duplicates to ensure the validity of the solution. It examines each row, column, and 3x3 box to confirm that no numbers are repeated. This validation process ensures that the solved puzzle follows the rules of Sudoku.
